"""Clear the stored view translations so the renamed tab can land.

The shop's first tab now reads "Class Types" rather than "Classes", to
agree with the heading above it, and the trial moved onto a page of its
own with strings that have never been translated before.

As with .18 through .38: the database already holds a translated arch for
these views and Odoo never overwrites an existing translation, so the new
catalogue entries cannot land until the stored copy is cleared.

Fresh installs are skipped: nothing stale to clear, and their translations
come straight from the .po on first import.
